### Project Description

---

Many existing Lego websites lack user-centered design and appeal to resellers, leading to a less engaging user experience and a site promoting the price gouging of Lego sets. Brick by Brick is focused on giving an eye appealing and user-friendly approach to browsing Lego sets. Powered by BrickLinks API, Brick by Brick is able to cross compare sets that you own to sets you would like to build by every individual part!

Brick by Brick Values

* Sustainability:
  * Cut down the need for new Lego sets by recycling the users existing Lego parts to use for new builds.
* Cost-Effective:
  * Reduces the users need to purchase new sets at high reseller prices and focus on saving money.
* Convenience:
  * Brick by Brick was made to be user friendly compared to other competitors websites. Our main mission was to save the users time searching for sets and individual parts they come with.
* Community:
  * Built by Lego fans, Brick by Brick is dedicated to foster a sense of community by allowing users to browse the many options on new sets they can build and share them with the world!
